Python Local Server to upload and download files from the phone!


So easy to use!

# How to Run the Flask File Upload Server

### Execution:

1. **Save the code as `serverforfiles.py`.**

2. **Run the script in your terminal:**

   Open your terminal, navigate to the directory where `serverforfiles.py` is saved, and run:

   ```bash
   python serverforfiles.py
   ```

This will start the server, making it available at the following URL:
   ```bash
   http://<your-local-ip>:8000/ bash
   ```

Replace <your-local-ip> with your actual local IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.x). You can check your local IP address using ipconfig (Windows) or ifconfig (Linux/Mac) in your terminal.

Access the server from your mobile or any other device on the same network:

Use the URL http://<your-local-ip>:8000/ in your mobile browser or any device connected to the same network. You will be able to upload files and download them directly from this URL.

All the interface texts and buttons will be displayed in Spanish, but the file handling functionality remains fully operational regardless of language.

Notes:
Ensure that your device and the computer running the script are connected to the same local network (e.g., the same Wi-Fi).
